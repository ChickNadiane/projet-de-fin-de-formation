<p class="deux">My name is sam-Thomas ‚ÄúToday I received my fourth gift of red blood cells. 
  I‚Äôve also had transfusions of platelets, three of those, so that‚Äôs seven transfusions of blood products so far: the magic liquid which keeps us alive. I have acute myeloid leukaemia, with cancer crowding out my good blood cells in my bone marrow, and I need regular transfusions of red blood cells and platelets
   to stay alive. Those who donate it are giving me, and many others, the gift of life.</p>
